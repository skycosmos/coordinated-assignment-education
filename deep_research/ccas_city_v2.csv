Families register students online and select a preferred school; if the chosen school is not oversubscribed, the student simply confirms enrollment. If it is oversubscribed, a centralized process allocates seats. For most schools this is done by a computerized lottery (using a random ""momento"" timestamp draw), with special priority given to certain groups such as students with disabilities, top academic achievers (flag bearers), and those with siblings at the school ([educacion.jujuy.gob.ar](https://educacion.jujuy.gob.ar/ingreso2026/#:~:text=,la%20misma%20oportunidad%20de%20ingresar)) ([educacion.jujuy.gob.ar](https://educacion.jujuy.gob.ar/ingreso-preguntas/#:~:text=ESTUDIANTES%20CON%20DISCAPACIDAD%20aquellos%20estudiantes,la%20instituci%C3%B3n%20de%20Educaci%C3%B3n%20Primaria)). In a subset of highly demanded schools (about 15–20 institutions), an entrance exam in core subjects is required; admission to those is based on the evaluative test results ([educacion.jujuy.gob.ar](https://educacion.jujuy.gob.ar/ingreso2026/#:~:text=,De%20esta%20manera%20todos)). Each student receives at most one offer per round of assignment, and unplaced students can apply again in a second round. This Coordinated Choice and Assignment System was first implemented in 2021 via an online pre‐inscription and lottery process ([educacion.jujuy.gob.ar](https://educacion.jujuy.gob.ar/2021/09/30/la-preinscripcion-virtual-a-1o-ano-de-secundaria-inicia-el-18-de-octubre/#:~:text=Asimismo%2C%20precis%C3%B3%20que%20%E2%80%9Cestas%20im%C3%A1genes,necesarios%20para%20confirmar%20la%20vacante%E2%80%9D)), and was updated in 2024 to introduce the exam requirement for certain schools ([boletinoficial.jujuy.gob.ar](https://boletinoficial.jujuy.gob.ar/?p=297880#:~:text=ARTICULO%202%C2%B0.,II%20de%20la%20presente%20Resoluci%C3%B3n)).

Applicants apply separately to multiple institutions or programs, rather than submitting one ranked preference list ([educacion.jujuy.gob.ar](https://educacion.jujuy.gob.ar/2025/11/26/inician-las-preinscripciones-para-el-ingreso-a-carreras-de-educacion-superior-2026/#:~:text=Desde%20el%2015%20de%20diciembre,que%20una%20persona%20puede%20inscribirse)).

Admission is based on each institution’s entrance course and mandatory exam; candidates are ranked by exam performance (academic merit) and admitted up to the available slots ([educacion.jujuy.gob.ar](https://educacion.jujuy.gob.ar/2025/11/26/inician-las-preinscripciones-para-el-ingreso-a-carreras-de-educacion-superior-2026/#:~:text=El%20cursillo%20contar%C3%A1%20con%20una,cupos%20disponibles%20en%20cada%20IES)). For example, the National University of Jujuy conducts its own preparatory modules and entrance exam, producing a merit list to select a limited number of new students (e.g., 600 seats) ([noticias.unju.edu.ar](https://noticias.unju.edu.ar/noticia.php?id=4645#:~:text=Quienes%20aprueben%20los%20m%C3%B3dulos%20podr%C3%A1n,ser%C3%A1n%20los%20600%20nuevos%20ingresantes)). Because students can receive offers from more than one institution and must choose where to enroll, no centralized algorithm assigns a single offer per applicant. No evidence of a fully Coordinated Choice and Assignment System (CCAS) was found; the 2024 introduction of the NEXO portal streamlined the process but did not implement a centralized matching mechanism ([prensa.jujuy.gob.ar](https://prensa.jujuy.gob.ar/sistema-nexo/comienza-preinscripcion-carreras-nivel-superior-n117818#:~:text=Por%20primera%20vez%2C%20a%20trav%C3%A9s,el%20acceso%20a%20la%20informaci%C3%B3n))."

This coordinated choice and assignment system applies to public schools only, while private and faith-based schools manage admissions independently. A notable policy change in 2020 removed automatic entry for younger siblings of students admitted via selective programs, tightening that priority rule ([www.education.sa.gov.au](https://www.education.sa.gov.au/parents-and-families/enrol-school-or-preschool/school-enrolment/placement-school#:~:text=Siblings%20already%20in%20a%20selective,interest%20program%20in%20high%20school)).

SATAC processes applications and provides lists of eligible applicants to institutions, which then determine offers that SATAC issues on their behalf ([satac.edu.au](https://satac.edu.au/satacs-role#:~:text=SATAC%E2%80%99s%20job%20is%20to%20process,the%20offers%20on%20their%20behalf)). The system includes both public and private tertiary institutions ([satac.edu.au](https://satac.edu.au/satacs-role#:~:text=,Torrens%20University%20Australia)). Admission is primarily merit-based (using the ATAR or equivalent academic score) ([www.adelaide.edu.au](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/print60381.html#:~:text=The%20SATAC%20Board%20also%20agreed,for%20the%202014%20university%20intakes)). However, adjustment factors are applied for equity and subject-based criteria: under the Universities Equity Scheme, students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds (e.g., low SES or rural) can receive bonus points, and under the Language, Literacy and Mathematics Scheme, students are rewarded for certain high school subjects ([www.adelaide.edu.au](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/print60381.html#:~:text=agreed%20unanimously%20at%20their%20meeting,off%20scores%2C%20and)) ([www.satac.edu.au](https://www.satac.edu.au/adjustment-factors#:~:text=SATAC%E2%80%99s%20participating%20institutions%20have%20two,provide%20adjustment%20factors%20to%20applicants)). These adjustments (capped at 9 points total) influence an applicant’s selection rank ([www.satac.edu.au](https://www.satac.edu.au/adjustment-factors#:~:text=We%20will%20adjust%20your%20aggregate,a%20maximum%20of%209%20points)) but do not depend on preference order ([www.satac.edu.au](https://www.satac.edu.au/preferences#:~:text=Your%20selection%20rank%20is%20not,the%20order%20of%20your%20preferences)). The matching mechanism effectively ensures applicants are admitted to the highest preference for which they qualify, reflecting a deferred acceptance approach ([www.satac.edu.au](https://www.satac.edu.au/preferences#:~:text=Preferences%20and%20offers)). The centralized system was introduced in 1977 ([satac.edu.au](https://satac.edu.au/satacs-role#:~:text=Established%20in%201977%20by%20the,education%20institutions%20in%20the%20state)).

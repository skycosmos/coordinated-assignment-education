        "summary": "This paper examines the Boston Public Schools (BPS) student assignment system, highlighting its challenges and potential improvements. The current mechanism, implemented in 1999, requires students entering grades K, 1, 6, and 9 to rank at least three schools in order of preference. The system prioritizes younger siblings attending the same school as older siblings, students from the school's walk zone, and uses random numbers for additional prioritization. The paper discusses the strategic difficulties parents face, as ranking a preferred school first can be risky if the student is not admitted, potentially losing spots in other preferred schools. The authors describe the Boston mechanism as a priority matching system, similar to those used in other U.S. cities and historically in the UK for medical internships. The paper also explores alternative mechanisms like deferred-acceptance algorithms, which could mitigate the strategic risks inherent in the current system. The study was prompted by a request from BPS for advice on redesigning their assignment mechanism, following a history of desegregation efforts and the elimination of racial preferences in 1999.",

        "summary": "This paper discusses the decision by the Boston School Committee to replace the existing Boston school choice mechanism with a deferred acceptance mechanism in 2005. The authors present empirical evidence against the previous Boston mechanism, which was a priority matching mechanism, and argue for the adoption of a strategy-proof mechanism. The paper highlights the strategic behavior of parents under the old system, where some parents were able to manipulate their preferences to gain better school placements, while others were disadvantaged by not doing so. The authors argue that the deferred acceptance mechanism is fairer and eliminates the need for strategic behavior, thus leading to more efficient and equitable student assignments. The paper also compares the deferred acceptance mechanism with the top trading cycles mechanism, ultimately supporting the former for its simplicity and effectiveness in addressing the issues identified with the Boston mechanism.",

        "summary": "This paper examines how market design choices in school choice systems can exacerbate or mitigate pre-existing inequalities among participants, particularly focusing on the role of outside options. The authors introduce outside options into a school choice model and demonstrate that students with outside options prefer manipulable mechanisms over strategy-proof ones. The paper empirically tests this theory using the transition from the Boston mechanism to the Deferred Acceptance mechanism in New Haven, Connecticut, in 2019. The study finds that under the Boston mechanism, students with outside options are more likely to list popular schools, a gap that disappears with the Deferred Acceptance mechanism. The findings suggest that strategy-proof mechanisms can reduce inequalities by not giving an advantage to students with better outside options.",

        "summary": "This paper investigates the factors influencing students' preferences for high schools and the extent to which these schools contribute to students' academic success. The authors develop a structural model to estimate students' preferences and the average valuation placed on each school, controlling for endogeneity using creative instruments. The study finds that school valuation is significantly influenced by the school's location, selectivity (measured by cutoff scores), value added, and past performance in university entrance exams. However, cutoff scores have a much larger impact on school valuation than value added. The research focuses on the Turkish education system, where admissions to elite exam schools are based on competitive national exams. The study uses data on all high schools in Turkey that admit students based on these exams, including admission cutoff scores, number of seats, and mean performance in university entrance exams. The authors estimate a nested logit model of preferences over high schools, considering that exam schools admit only the highest-scoring applicants. The paper contributes to understanding how students value different school characteristics and the role of selection versus value-added in educational outcomes.",

Using administrative data and a regression discontinuity design, the study examines how college-specific admissions thresholds affecting older siblings impact the educational decisions of younger siblings. The findings reveal that younger siblings are significantly more likely to follow their older siblings to the same college or college-major combination, with spillover effects disappearing if the older sibling drops out. The study highlights the role of family and social networks in shaping higher education trajectories and suggests that interventions to improve college access may have multiplier effects.",
